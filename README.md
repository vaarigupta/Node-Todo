# Todo - API
It facilitates user by creating Todos without any chaos and maintains the record of task to be performed and completeness of the task. 
In this application , I have implemented such functionality of CRUD operations where a user can
```
Create
Read
Update
Delete
```
It is an API where JSON is Submitted to the application and can be fetched , updated and deletd via POSTMAN .
